  Title          : command.h
  Author         : Stewart Weiss
  Created on     : April 12, 2018
  Description    : Interface for the command class
  Purpose        : The Command class represents a command object
  Modifications  : 

  Notes:
  This header file provides the interface to the Command class, as well as to
  a few types that are required in order to use this class, specifically the 
  following enumerated type:
    Command_type

  All of the member functions required to utilize this class are here. 
  There is no need to modify this class and it should not be modified!

  The accompanying test driver, commandtester.cpp, show how you can use this 
  class.  In essence, you create a Command object and then repeatedly call
  the get_next() method passing the input stream containing the commands.
  Use type_of() and get_args() to get the command type and its associated
  argument list.

/** Command_type: 
    An enumerated type to represent the different types of commands. This is  
    more efficient than storing command types as strings. Notice that the last
    value of the type is num_Command_types, which is simply a count of how many
    values the type contains. It is a useful method of counting, because as long
    as you insert new values before it, it remains valid.
